Here is a dump of all things on the journey to reverse engineer the Mazda RX-8 ECU/PCM and define the tables and modified values for use in ROMraider


Reverse Engineering Tool: Ghidra - https://ghidra-sre.org/
ROMRaider - https://www.romraider.com/

Folders:

Data_Binaries

These are live data binaries, and some ROM files I have taken

Ghidra_Archives

This is where I am stashing my latest ghidra archives. Ghidra (from what I can tell) doesn't have a great way to collaborate, so this is the best I can do
	
Stock_ROMs

Uploaded Stock ROM binary files
